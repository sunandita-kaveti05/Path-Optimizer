# Path-Optimizer
# Intelligent Path Optimizer for Delivery Agents

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Intelligent Path Optimizer** is a backend system designed to help **delivery agents** find the most efficient paths while considering real-world constraints like **traffic, delivery time windows, and priority orders**. This project leverages **graph algorithms and data structures** to optimize delivery routes dynamically.

## 🚀 Why is it Important?
- **Minimizes delivery time** 📉 by finding the shortest and most efficient routes.
- **Reduces fuel costs** ⛽ by optimizing travel distances.
- **Handles multiple constraints** ⏳ like real-time traffic, delivery priority, and order deadlines.
- **Improves customer satisfaction** 😊 with faster and more reliable deliveries.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install required Python libraries
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Backend Server
```sh
python main.py  # Start the backend service
```

## 🔮 Future Scope
- 🛰️ **Integrate real-time traffic data** using Google Maps API.
- 📊 **Implement AI-based predictive routing** for better accuracy.
- 🌍 **Deploy the system on cloud platforms** for scalability.

## 🤝 Contribution
This is a real-world problem-solving project, and contributions are welcome! Feel free to suggest improvements or collaborate. 🚀
